To run the demo run the Q4.processing file  

Controls are as follows  (mouse must be focused on window by clicking):
d engages dual display mode, displaying true culture agents as two lighter colors of blue and pink depending on sex
                             and others as red or orange depending on sex. This is the default display mode
s engages sex display mode,  displaying 'X' sexed agents as blue and 'Y' sexed agents as pink
f engaged fertility display mode, displaying agents that are fertile as cyan and those who aren't as orange
c engages culture mode, displaying agents that are true culture as blue and others as red 

Graphs are as follows from top to bottom:
averageWealth displays the mean wealth of agents on the grid
averageAge displays the mean age of agents on the grid
trueCulture displays the percent of true culture on the grid, 0% at the bottom of the graph and 100% at the top
numAgents displays the total number of agents on the grid

If all agents die the program will exit with that message
